## User Story 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


### Acceptance Criteria
-GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
-WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
-WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order





-*WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes# üêõ Custom Font Styles Aren't Loading

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I expect headings to be a larger font size.

* As a user, I expect spacing in between the lines of text.

## Expected Behavior

The blog title and article headings should be a larger font size.

## Actual Behavior

The headings are the same size as the other text on the page.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:
